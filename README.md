## Heilsan mín

Welcome to our group assignment Module 3 in Tækniskólinn! (Reykjavík Technical School) 

We made an Icelandic health tracker calendar app. It is a single page Interactive and Responsive Web Application. 

The user can create their own conditions or appointments that will be logged into a calendar. All logged information is stored in local storage so that the user can keep track of his/her own health.  


## Usage

+ Clone this project and open up the [index.html](index.html) to view the page. 
+ All styles where made with Sass and are in [Styles folder](styles).
+ All Javascript is in [Javascripts folder](js) with comments. 

## Live Demo

Go to [Heilsan mín](http://heilsanmin.surge.sh/) to view a live demo of the page\.
